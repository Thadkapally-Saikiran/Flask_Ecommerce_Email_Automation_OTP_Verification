Key Workflow Explanation:

1. Initialization

    User starts at home page (/) and enters number of recipients

    Session stores recipient count for multi-step process

2. Data Collection

    Dynamic form generation based on recipient count

    Collects product details, delivery info, and payment method

    Generates unique OTP for each recipient

3. Email Delivery

    Establishes secure SMTP connection

    Sends personalized emails with delivery details and OTP

    Stores OTPs in session for verification phase

4. OTP Verification

    Presents OTP input fields for each recipient

    Compares user input with generated OTPs

    Provides color-coded results table

5. Security Considerations

    Session management for multi-step flow

    Encrypted SMTP connections (TLS)

    Server-side validation of all inputs

    Flash messages for user feedback

    Proper connection cleanup in finally block

To Enhance Security:

    Store credentials in environment variables

    Add CSRF protection

    Implement rate limiting

    Add user authentication

    Use HTTPS in production

This implementation provides a complete workflow from email composition to OTP verification 
with proper error handling and user feedback.
